        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
          <p>Anxious is an American emo band from Fairfield, Connecticut. The band is currently signed to Run for Cover Records. The band released their debut album in 2022 titled Little Green House. The album was named Stereogum's "Album of the Week". The album received positive reviews.
          </p>
          <p>Anxious was founded in 2016 in Darien, Connecticut by vocalist/guitarist Grady Allen, vocalist/bassist Sam Walter and drummer Michelle Siegel. In 2017, Siegel left the group and was replaced by Dante Melucci. That same year, the band independently recorded and released their debut E.P. Carved. In 2019, they recruited lead guitarist Ryan Savitsky and signed to Triple-B Records. That year, the group recorded and released two more E.P's, Promo 2019 and Never Better. Also that year, Grady Allen ceased playing guitar in the group. Melucci subsequently switched from drums to lead guitar/backing vocals, and Jonny Camner replaced him on drums/percussion. Shortly afterwards, Walter left the group and was replaced by bassist/backing vocalist Sam Allen.
